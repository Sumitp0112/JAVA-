Syntax : for ( initialization ; condition ; update)
          {
            Statement ;
          }

- In for loop, The initialization,condition,update is done simultaneously / together with ';'
  (semicolon) seperation which has a block which contain Statement.
- The condition must be a boolean type.

--Working--

= First the initialization is done and the control goes to the condition
- If condition evaluate true, the statement of block executed and then control gors to the update.
- Onec update is done control goes to the check condition agian, if comdition evaluate true, this cycle repeats until 
  condition becomes false.

  **NOTE**
  - We cannot use while loop / do-while loop without condition, we get CTE.
  - But we can use for loop without initialization,condition and updatation
    (It goes for infinite iteration (  ;  ;  ) ).
