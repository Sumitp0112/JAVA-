Syntax : 
        Switch(value/expression/variable)
        {
            case val/exp:
            {
                Statement;
                break;
            }
             case val/exp:
            {
                Statement;
                break;
            }
             case val/exp:
            {

- In switch we can pass value/expression/variable, which has a block which contain multiple cases 
  block along with default block.
- The value Pass in switch is compaired with the value a case.
- If value match that case block execute and if a break statement is provided the control exit switch block.
- If break statement not provided the rest of block executed until it's find break statement.
- When the case value in switch and value in case does not match the control shift to exit next case.
- If None of the case matches the default block execated if provided or else executed nothing.
- Using default block not mandatory.
- Using break statement not mandatory.
- In switch we can  Pass valuel/Expression/variable but in case we can pass only value / Expression.
-Data type such as byte, short, int, char, String are allowed. but long, float, double not allowed.

# Break statement:
- Break is keyword and control transfer statement.
- It is a also known as jump statement.
- A Break statement can be use inside a switch  or loop statement.
- Break tranfer the control out of the switch block or loop Block.
